### Installing Node

Backpack is developed using Node, using the following versions:

* `LTS/Carbon` (Node ^8.12.0)
* `^6.4.1` (npm)

This is enforced using a pre-install hook that calls out to [ensure-node-env](https://github.com/Skyscanner/ensure-node-env).

If you use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [nave](https://github.com/isaacs/nave) to manage your Node environment, Backpack has built-in support for these. Just run `nvm use` or `nave auto` to install the correct Node version.

To install npm, use `npm install --global npm@^6.4.1`.

### Code style

Backpack uses a combination of [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to enforce coding styles. ESLint runs as a pre-commit hook, so it isn't possible to commit code that causes ESLint to fail.

We recommend that you install [a plugin to your editor](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations#editors) to run ESLint automatically, which will then show you any errors inline. You can even enable an option to fix ESLint errors automatically upon saving.

## Getting started

### Cloning

`backpack-docs` makes use of submodules. Run `git clone --recursive git@github.com:Skyscanner/backpack-docs.git` to clone the repo.

The `--recursive` flag will ensure that you also clone all necessary submodules to run the docs locally.

For more help using submodules, see the [more detailed Submodules section](#submodules)

### Install dependencies

Run `npm install` to install dependencies from npm.

Then use `npm run build-backpack` to install dependencies for the web submodule, and ensure everything is built.

#### Backpack documentation

When adding documentation for a new component:

 * Add the new dependency in `package.json` and run `npm i` to install it.
 * Add routes for your new component in `docs/src/constants/Routes.js` and `docs/src/constants/redirect-routes.js`.
 * Add new link in `docs/src/layouts/links.js`.

 Assets from other repositories are accessed via git submodules, which are automatically updated when the docs are deployed.

 For help writing documentation, see Skyscanner's [copywriting guide](https://backpack.github.io/style-guide/copywriting) and Backpack's [guide for writing docs](/decisions/writing-docs.md).

## How to

<details>
<summary>Create a pull request to Backpack</summary>

For anything non-trivial, we strongly recommend speaking to somebody from Backpack squad before starting work on a PR. This lets us pass on any advice or knowledge we already have about the work you're proposing. It might even be something we're already working on. After this, follow the steps below.

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/Skyscanner/backpack-docs/fork).
2. Create a new branch.
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit and push your new branch.
5. Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/Skyscanner/backpack-docs/pulls).
6. Notify someone in Backpack squad or drop a note in #backpack.

Bear in mind that small, incremental pull requests are likely to be reviewed faster.

<details>
<summary>Run tests</summary>

`npm test` will pick up any files that end in `-test.js`, so you don't need to do anything to make Jest pick them up.

You can also run the tests in 'watch mode', which means the process will continually run and run tests every time files change. Use `npm run jest:watch` to do this.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Run the documentation site</summary>

The Backpack documentation is a standalone client-side app. Each package has its own page, which you can find and edit in the `bpk-docs` package under `src/pages`.

The “page” modules themselves contain introductory blurbs and examples for the respective component. They also import the component’s README, which you should have created as part of your component.

You can run the docs app locally using:

```sh
npm run docs
```

And loading [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

The web Map component page requires an environment variable named `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`. During builds, this is set by Travis.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Run linters manually</summary>

* `npm run lint` to lint both JS and SCSS.
* `npm run lint:js` to lint JS.
* `npm run lint:js:fix` to lint and try to automatically fix any errors.
* `npm run lint:scss` to lint SCSS.

</details>

## Submodules

`backpack`, `backpack-android`, `backpack-ios` and `backpack-react-native` folders are git submodules.

The documentation build will ensure the local submodules are up to date before using it so there is no need to do any git command directly. That being
said, from time to time it's good to update the submodules to point to a newer commit so fewer changes will be pulled before each doc build.

To do the above run `npm run submodules:update` and then `git push origin master`.

Sometimes you may encounter an error when running `npm test` or running linting, that states an error of `module not found`. This issue can be related to the submodules not being cloned when working with the codebase.

If this issue occurs run `git submodule update --init --recursive` which will clone all the submodules to your local codebase.

## And finally..

If you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to get in touch. We love to talk all things Backpack and we look forward to seeing your contribution!
