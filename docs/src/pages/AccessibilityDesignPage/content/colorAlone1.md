# Color 1
## Colour alone
By not relying on colour alone to describe something, everyone will be able to understand the meaning.

## Who
- low vision
- colour blindness
- other vision impairment
- cognitive impairments that affect vision, like dyslexia
- viewing screen in extreme conditions, like bright sunlight

## How
Use more than colour alone to convey meaning.
