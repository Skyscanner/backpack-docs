# Color 1
## Color contrast
Travellers can struggle to read text or UI elements when there isn't high enough contrast between the foreground and background colours.

## Who
 - low vision
 - colour blindness
 - other vision impairment
 - cognitive impairments that affect vision, like dyslexia
 - viewing screen in extreme conditions, like bright sunlight

## How
Use colour pairings with high contrast to make text easy to read by everyone. This also applies to icons or images that we need travellers to see properly to be able to understand what's going on.
