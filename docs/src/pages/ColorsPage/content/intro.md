Our colour palette is built around a bold lead colour, Sky Blue. It represents clarity and optimism, and above all embodies the sky of a perfect trip — year round. 

We are a multi-colour brand, and support Sky Blue with a wider palette of warm, natural colours that represent the rich hues found all over our planet — from bustling cities to untouched natural landscapes.
