* Number one rule: good writing always puts the traveller first.
* Good writing doesn't mean using lots of adjectives.
* It means making sure every sentence we write is helpful.
* So, how can we be helpful?

**Be specific.** If we say, 'The hotel is a short walk from the train station,' that's pretty vague - what do we mean by 'short'? But if we say, 'The hotel is a mile's walk (with lots of steps, be prepared if you've got kids) from the train station', we're giving people information they can use.

**Make it easy to understand.** The best writing doesn't sound like you're trying to be too clever - it just sounds natural. Say what you mean, and say it clearly - like you would to a friend.

**Make it personal.** Why should people trust us? Use your experience to show them you know what you're talking about. 'The food was delicious,' doesn't tell anyone anything, really. Instead try, 'The restaurant fuses Italian and Californian flavours. Their short rib with gnocchi is one of the best things I've ever tasted: really smoky and rich.'

**Be interesting.** Travel is exciting, so we shouldn't make it sound boring. 'The museum has lots of historical artifacts' = zzzzz. But 'the museum is awesome - I saw a collection of real-life shrunken heads' sounds pretty interesting, doesn't it?

**Be honest.** We want people to make informed choices. So if there's something you think might bother people, tell them. So you might say: 'This hotel is great: friendly staff, comfy beds and value for money. But you will need to be comfortable with shared bathrooms.' Or: 'This is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in - but it's also one of the most expensive.'

## Also, size matters

Operate on the goldilocks principle. We think a good review is probably about 150-200 wordsâ€¦not too long, not too short, but just right. In literary terms, it's longer than a tweet, but (much) shorter than a novel. Save longer-form writing for your diary.
