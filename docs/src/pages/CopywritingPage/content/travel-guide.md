## Writing the introduction

If you're writing a travel guide- say, if you're rounding up the best bars in Tokyo, or the best food in Madrid - you'll need to write an introduction.

This is your big chance to get people really excited about what they might find out in the rest of the article. You have to hook them in right away, though - they're just one click away from missing out on your great advice.

The good news is, all you need to do is follow the rules. Put the traveller first - what would it be helpful for them to know? Can you give them a sense of the experiences they're likely to have?

Now tell them those things in a way that is specific, clear, personal, interesting and honest.

**Here's an example of an introduction that needs a bit of work:**

*"The most popular state to visit in India, Rajasthan, is also the one that is better geared to tourism. Here you'll find beautiful, comfortable hotels located in historic buildings and delicious restaurants that serve the freshest and most delicious food abound. This guide gives guidance to the best places to stay and the most delicious places to eat in Rajasthan, for all budgets."*

This doesn't really tell us very much about Rajasthan. Lots of places have nice hotels and nice food, after all. What makes Rajasthan different? Why do you think people should get excited?

**Let's rewrite this sentence by sentence.**

*"The most popular state to visit in India, Rajasthan, is also the one that is better geared to tourism."*

Keep the rules in mind, and you get something more like:

*"Rajasthan is India's most popular state with travellers - it gets a massive 35 million visitors a year. It's not hard to see why. This is one of the most colourful places on Earth, from - my personal favourite - the blue-painted city of Jodhpur, to the golden sand fortresses rising out of desert town Jaisalmer. Plus, because Rajasthan is so used to tourists, it's one of the easier parts of India to visit (the famously chaotic country can sometimes be a bit overwhelming)."*

Next up:

*"Here, beautiful, comfortable hotels located in historic buildings and delicious restaurants that serve the freshest and most delicious food abound."*

How about:

*"Rajasthan isn't short of comfortable hotels, and many of them are set in impressive historic buildings, like former palaces and havelis (a traditional Indian mansion, often decorated with amazing, brightly coloured paintings). And fantastic restaurants are everywhere - Rajasthani food is less spicy than most Indian food, with lots of bread and dumplings to dip in tangy sauces."*

Then:

*"This guide gives guidance to the best places to stay and the most delicious places to eat in Rajasthan, for all budgets."*

Instead, why not try something like:

*"Here are my favourite places to stay and eat in Rajasthan - from life-changing street snacks, to a hotel where you won't ever want to leave the outrageously comfy bed. All budgets covered!"*


## Writing a review

More good news - again, we're just following the rules. They'll always be the same, whether you're writing about a restaurant, a hotel, or a city. Start with: what are the most useful, interesting things you can tell people about each place?

**Here's a restaurant recommendation that needs some work:**

*"Fabulous restaurant in a fantastic location in Udaipur, that ticks all the boxes. The atmosphere is incredible, whether for a business meeting or for a family lunch. The food is delicious, always prepared from scratch. The service is spot on. And the prices are more than reasonable given what you get. Recommended."*

OK, so it's a fantastic location and the atmosphere is incredible - but why?

Great, the food is delicious - but what was it like, and what did you order?

Yay, the prices are reasonable! But, um, what are they?

**Better to say:**

*"This restaurant has one of the best locations in Udaipur, right on the shore of Lake Pichola (grab an outdoor table, and you'll get an amazing view of the City Palace). Don't miss the raan: an unbelievably tender roast leg of lamb (I think I actually drooled on it). This is a pricier option than your usual Indian restaurant - dishes start at about 500 rupees (Â£6) - but the quality, portions and setting are worth it."*

An anecdote achieves a lot more than a throwaway statement. So, instead of saying "Service is spot on", you might say,  "Service is fast and thoughtful - our waiter warned us about the really spicy dishes and our water glass never got empty."

All in all, if you just follow the rules, it's pretty simple. And it's fun to show people cool stuff - so why not show them as much cool stuff as you can?
