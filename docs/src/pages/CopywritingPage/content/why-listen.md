Imagine you met a really boring person at a party. They might have lots of good knowledge, but you're probably not going to listen to them. (Same goes for if they're really snobby, or obviously thinks they're just, like, too cool. Blergh.)

Now imagine you met someone really funny and entertaining. But the things they told you were just plain wrong. You probably wouldn't take their advice, because you couldn't trust a word they said.

So, we need people to enjoy hanging out with us - but they need to trust that we know what we're talking about, too.
