Shadows are our richest visual identity element, enabling us to express an abstract sense of place. They isolate a location's often overlooked beautiful details, and build on our visual identity's unique relationship with light. 

From nature to architecture, and abstract to prop, our shadow categories capture a wide range of details, allowing us to evoke straightforward or complex experiences.
