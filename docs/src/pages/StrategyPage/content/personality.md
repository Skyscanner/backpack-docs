**Helpful**: There’s no problem too big or too small and we’ll do everything we can to make someone’s trip better. We get to the point and give people the information they need so they can make the best decision possible.

**Joyful**: Because we’re excited about travel, we want to get other people excited about it, too. We’re wired to pick up on our travellers' thoughts and feelings and know when to use our natural charisma and accessible sense of humour to create a lasting bond with our travellers.

**Straightforward**: We are clear and easy to understand, using balanced sentences and everyday words. So forget jargon and kill the business speak. We don’t try to hide anything — we’re all about giving people the information they need to make the best decisions possible.

**Bold**: We act with conviction and sound big, brave and inspiring. We empower and encourage travellers to try new things, opening people up to the possibilities of travel. Crucially, we’re not afraid of voicing our opinion.
