## Table of contents

## Default

This is the most basic method of displaying suggestions.

Note that they can be indented (to indicate topology for example) - type "a" to see this demonstrated by the Glasgow office suggestion.

<PresentationBlock>
  <AutosuggestExample />
</PresentationBlock>

## Icons

You can insert a [Backpack icon](/components/icon) next to each suggestion, useful for differentiation e.g. between airports, cities, and countries.

<PresentationBlock>
  <AutosuggestExample includeIcon />
</PresentationBlock>

## Subheadings

Additional suggestion information can be displayed as a subheading.

<PresentationBlock>
  <AutosuggestExample includeSubheading />
</PresentationBlock>

## Tertiary label

If subheadings are not enough, you can add some tertiary information too.

<PresentationBlock>
  <AutosuggestExample includeTertiaryLabel />
</PresentationBlock>

## Combination

This example shows all of the above combined.

<PresentationBlock>
  <AutosuggestExample includeIcon includeSubheading includeTertiaryLabel/>
</PresentationBlock>
