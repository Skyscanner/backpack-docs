## Usage advice

<UsageTable

    dos: [
      'Use the large and small sizes as they are provided, so that we deliver consistent, accessible buttons across the product.',
    ],
    donts: [
      "Don't override font properties or the size of the button using custom styles, as you will make the component inconsistent and inaccessible.",
    ],
  }}
/>

## Link buttons

As links, Link buttons are used as a tertiary means of triggering actions. The styling of Link buttons is different from links due to the vertical padding applied to Link buttons. Like all other buttons, these are available in two sizes and have hover, active and disabled states.

## Accessibility considerations

### Repeated button labels

Sometimes design requires showing buttons that are visually the same, for example, seeing 'Select' repeated multiple times on a search results page.

Visually impaired visitors can get context by manually navigating around the content. Still, when exploring via buttons, they often hear 'Select', 'Select', and 'Select', with no context regarding what will be selected.

To improve the experience, Designers & UX writers should supply what information a visitor may need to help them make their choice. Use CSS or ARIA to give visually impaired users this information.

### Icon-only buttons

Buttons always require a label for people to understand their meaning.

If a visual label isn't present then an accessible name should be provided to include visually impaired visitors. Designers & UX writers should supply this label.

<!--- ### Link buttons and links

Once link has been designed, this documentation may need updating to include guidance on when to use and not to use (see: https://marcysutton.com/links-vs-buttons-in-modern-web-applications

--->

### Disabled states

The `disabled` attribute prevents click and focus, creating an annoying experience for some visitors, such as visually impaired screen reader users who may not quickly locate a submit button on a long form.

Using `aria-disabled` allows these visitors to focus on the button and announce the status. Considerations need to be made on click events. Click could be prevented or enabled with the click event taking the visitor to the first missing form element.

### Loading states

When a button is in its loading state, it is disabled from further interaction until the action completes or the action fails to complete.

Visually impaired visitors should also be updated on progress. If a visual label is not on the loading button, then visually hidden text should update when significant events happen. To further improve the experience, time-based feedback could reassure the visitor that something is still happening.


## Accessibility testing

### Keyboard testing

1. Press `TAB` until the button receives focus.
2. Ensure that the button has a recognisable outline to clearly identify the state.
3. Press `SPACEBAR` or `ENTER` to activate the button.

### Screen reader testing

**Safari & VoiceOver**

1. Open the rotor (default `CONTROL` `OPTION` and `U`).
2. Use the arrow keys to navigate to the 'Form Controls' menu.
3. Move down to the button you wish to test and press `ENTER`.
4. Ensure the purpose and role are clear, and announced. For example, 'Search flights, button'
5. If the button has a state, such as expanded, collapsed, or disabled, then this should also be announced.
6. Press `CONTROL` `OPTION` and `SPACEBAR` to activate the button.

<!--- 1. Press `TAB` until the button receives focus.
2. Ensure that the purpose of the button is clear.
3. Check that the button announces itself as having a role of button.
4. Ensure that the state of the button is clear, for example, `pressed`, `expanded` or `disabled`.
5. Press `SPACEBAR` or `ENTER` to activate the button. --->
