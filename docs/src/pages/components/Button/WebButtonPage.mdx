## Usage advice

<UsageTable
  data={{
    dos: [
      'Use the large and small sizes as they are provided, so that we deliver consistent, accessible buttons across the product.',
    ],
    donts: [
      "Don't override font properties or the size of the button using custom styles, as you will make the component inconsistent and inaccessible.",
    ],
  }}
/>

## Link buttons

As links, Link buttons are used as a tertiary means of triggering actions. The styling of Link buttons is different from links due to the vertical padding applied to Link buttons. Like all other buttons, these are available in two sizes and have hover, active and disabled states.
