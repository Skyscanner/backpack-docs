## Table of contents

## Default

By default, cards have built-in padding.

<PresentationBlock>
  <DefaultExample />
</PresentationBlock>

## Without padding

The padding can be removed if needed.

<PresentationBlock>
  <WithoutPaddingExample />
</PresentationBlock>

## Used as a link

Add a `href` prop to your card to turn it into a hyperlink.

<PresentationBlock>
  <WithHrefExample />
</PresentationBlock>

## Non-atomic

By default cards are atomic. That means that assistive technology will see the card as a single item, whose value is the content.

If the copy inside your card is lengthy, you should consider making it non-atomic and providing a CTA inside. The entire card will still be clickable/tappable, but will appear to AT as a dumb container.

<PresentationBlock>
  <NonAtomicHrefExample />
</PresentationBlock>

## With divider

`BpkDividedCard` is another card component with a divider. And it doesn't have padding and also supports `href` prop.

<PresentationBlock>
  <DefaultDividedCardExample />
</PresentationBlock>

## With divider arranged vertically

`BpkDividedCard` could be vertical.

<PresentationBlock>
  <VerticalDividedCardExample />
</PresentationBlock>

## Implementation
