## Table of contents

## Selectable

Selectable chips can be toggled on and off.

<PresentationBlock>
  <AllSelectableChipsExample />
</PresentationBlock>

## Dropdown

Dropdown chips can be toggled on and off and have a trailing chevron down icon.

  <AllDropdownChipsExample />
</PresentationBlock>

## Dismissible

Dismissible chips are useful when applying filters. They are designed to disappear when pressed, so they cannot be toggled on and off.

Note that if chips are being added or removed dynamically (like in the example below), you should render a [BpkAriaLive](/components/aria-live) container describing the updates taking place.

By doing this, assistive technologies will know to inform the user when changes are made. By default, only additions to the container will be read out, so you don't need to worry about removing entries again.

## Different styles

There are three styles of chips to choose from: _default_, _onDark_ and _onImage_.
