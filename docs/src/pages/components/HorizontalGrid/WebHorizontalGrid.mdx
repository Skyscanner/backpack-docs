## Table of contents

## Default

<PresentationBlock>

### Columns

The grid makes use of 12 percentage based columns, which means your layouts will scale no matter the browser size. Columns are separated by fixed width gutters and margins.

[View columns demo](/grid-column-demo)

### Offsets

Offsets allow you to shift columns to the right. Depending on their size, columns can be offset by 1 through 11.

[View offsets demo](/grid-offset-demo)

### Responsive behaviour

The grid works in conjunction with the [breakpoint component](/components/breakpoint) and can be used to position content differently based on these viewports by specifying different widths and offsets.

> **Note:** The Backpack grid is intended to be used for overall page layout as opposed to spacing out atom or molecule level components. Please stick to flexbox based techniques for more intricate layouts (or `display: table;` for browsers which lack support), just be sure to use the spacing values above in order to achieve consistency.
