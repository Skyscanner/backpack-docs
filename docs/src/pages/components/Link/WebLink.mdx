## Usage advice

<UsageTable
  data={{
    dos: [
      'Each link on a page should clearly describe where it will take you if you choose to follow it. E.g. "Skyscanner privacy policy."',
      'If a link contains an element such as an icon you should ensure it has suitable alt text for assistive technologies.',
      'If links open in a new window, users of assitive technologies should be informed of this by applying the appropriate aria-label which includes the text and the action. E.g. The aria-label could be "Skyscanner privacy policy, opens in a new tab".',
      'If a link contains a document ensure users are aware of this (type and size of file), this can either be provided in the link text itself or using an aria-label the contains the link name, type and size. E.g. "Booking confirmation (pdf, 1KB)".',
      'CSS can be used to hide text to hide a portion of the link text to provide more information to users of screen readers.',
      'Assigning aria-describedby and an ID can be used to associate text that is already present on the page with the link.',
    ],
    donts: [
      "Don't use an aria-label if the link is already completely satisfactory. aria-label should be used as a last resort.",
