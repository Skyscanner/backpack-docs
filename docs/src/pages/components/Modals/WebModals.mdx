## Usage advice

<UsageTable
  data={{
    dos: [
      "Use for rich or complex content related to the current page.",
      "Make sure it's very easy for users to dismiss them.",
      'Consider how the "Back" action is used. Users should normally be able to use this to close a modal and return to the underlying page.',
    ],
    donts: [
      "Don't use for alerts, errors and confirmations. Use a dialog instead.",
      "Avoid opening dialogs, other modals or popovers from non-full screen modals. (It's ok on full-screen modals because in this case they won't be perceived as adding too many extra layers or visual noise",
      "Don't overuse modals as interruptions, as they will get in the way of the user's main tasks, and may disrupt context. Never use a full screen modal as an interrupt.",
      "Don't stack modals. Only one should be open at a time.",
    ]
  }}
/>

## Default modal

The default modal has a title and a close button. On mobile viewports, it always occupies the entire screen. On desktop viewports, it comes in two widths: regular and wide.

<PresentationBlock>
  <DefaultExample />
</PresentationBlock>

## Text button

Modals can be configured to display the close button as text - useful for when a close icon doesn&apos;t fit the context.

<PresentationBlock>
  <CloseButtonTextExample />
</PresentationBlock>

## Full screen

Modals are always full screen on mobile.

They can be configured to occupy the full screen on desktop too. This should only be used in exceptional circumstances as part of a considered workflow.

<PresentationBlock>
  <FullScreenExample />
</PresentationBlock>
