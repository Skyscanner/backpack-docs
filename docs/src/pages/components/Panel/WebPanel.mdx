## Table of contents

## Default

This is the default panel type which comes with padding already applied to get you up and running quickly.

<PresentationBlock>
  <DefaultExample />
</PresentationBlock>

## Without Padding

As above, but without padding, allowing you to have full-bleed content or roll your own padding.

<PresentationBlock>
  <WithoutPaddingExample />
</PresentationBlock>

## Full width

This option allows you to make a panel full width, which is especially useful on small viewports.

<PresentationBlock>
  <FullWidthExample />
</PresentationBlock>

## Implementation
