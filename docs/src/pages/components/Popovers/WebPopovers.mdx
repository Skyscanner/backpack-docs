## Usage advice

<UsageTable
  data={{
    dos: [
      'Use to provide additional information related to an element on the page.',
      'Use when content is too long for a tooltip.',
      'Use when the user needs to access additional functionality, without losing their current place in the UI.',
      "Use when you want a contextual relationship with an element on screen that a modal or dialog can't provide.",
      'Use for feature prompts / onboarding.',
      'Popovers can be modal and shown on top of a scrim, especially for prompts.',
      'When an element is pressed to open the popover, pressing on the same element should close it again (especially on desktop).',
    ],
    donts: [
      "Don't use for complex content on mobile. In this case, a modal may be a better bet.",
      "Don't use when you want content to be accessed on hover.",
    ],
  }}
/>
