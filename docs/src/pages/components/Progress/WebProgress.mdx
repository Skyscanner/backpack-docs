## Table of contents

## Usage advice

<UsageTable
  data={{
    dos: [
      'Use exclusively for tracking user progress through a set of actions, for example a form.',
    ],
    donts: [
      "Don't use in other contexts. This component is described to screen readers as a progress bar, so using it in other contexts harms accessibility.",
    ],
  }}
/>

## Default

This is the default progress bar which animates in and automatically hides when complete.

<PresentationBlock>
  <DefaultExample />
</PresentationBlock>

## Small

This is very similar to the default progress bar but is a little thinner to fit nicely inline, e.g. at the top of a page.

<PresentationBlock>
  <SmallExample />
</PresentationBlock>

## Stepped

This option allows you to specify how many steps there are in a given task. These are great to guide users through longer processes such as completing a form.

<PresentationBlock>
  <SteppedExample />
</PresentationBlock>

## Accessibility

Ensure that you add `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to ensure good compatibility with assistive technologies. For more information, see [Deque University's advice on `aria-progressbar-name`](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.1/aria-progressbar-name).
