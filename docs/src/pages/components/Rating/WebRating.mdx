## Table of contents

## Default

The rating component's appearance changes based on the value provided.

<PresentationBlock>
  <DefaultExample />
</PresentationBlock>

## Large rating

<PresentationBlock>
  <LargeSizeExample />
</PresentationBlock>

## Title-only ratings

The rating component can have just a title with no subtitle. Here it's seen in both horizontal and vertical styles.

<PresentationBlock>
  <TitleOnlyExample />
</PresentationBlock>

## Alternate scale

By default, ratings follow a 0-5 scale. Set the `ratingScale` prop to use a 0-10 scale instead.

The 0-10 scale should only be used in specific circumstances, like ratings coming from an external provider that use a 0-10 scale. Most things should use the 0-5 scale to give users consistency.

<PresentationBlock>
  <ZeroToTenScaleExample />
</PresentationBlock>
