## Usage advice

<UsageTable
  data={{
      dos: [
        'Use for actions that cause immediate changes, for example toggling Wi-Fi on/off.',
      ],
      donts: [
        "Don't use for actions that have no immediate effect, like in a form. In that situation, use a checkbox.",
      ],
  }}
/>

## Default

The switch component uses a regular HTML checkbox behind the scenes to maintain semantic markup and good accessibility.

  <DefaultExample />
