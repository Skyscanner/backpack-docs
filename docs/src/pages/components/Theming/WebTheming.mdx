## About

Theming is based on [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables') and is not supported in some older browsers.

In these cases, Backpack components will gracefully degrade to the default Skyscanner theme. To check browser support, see [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables).
