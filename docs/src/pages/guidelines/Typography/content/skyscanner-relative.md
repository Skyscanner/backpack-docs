Our typeface is Skyscanner Relative, a unique type family of proportional graded weights.

Its forms reflect the geometry of our symbol, with even stroke widths and slightly rounded corner profiles. Optimised for use on-screen, we have worked alongside its creators, Colophon, to ensure fast load-times and perfect digital rendering.
