## Table of Contents

## What's in it?

* For improved cross-browser rendering, we use [`Normalize.css`](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to correct small inconsistencies across browsers and devices.
* The `box-sizing` is globally set on every element, including `*:before` and `*:after`, to `border-box`. This ensures that the declared width of an element is never exceeded due to padding or border.
* The default `color`, `font-family`, `font-size` & `line-height`.
Utility classes based on the [HTML5 Boilerplate common helpers](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/5.3.0/dist/doc/css.md#common-helpers), including: `.hidden`, `.visuallyhidden`, `.visuallyhidden.focusable`, `.invisible` and `.clearfix`.
* That's it!

> Note: There is also a small amount of JavaScript that does "[`Modernizr`](https://modernizr.com/)-like" feature detection (currently used to prevent hover effects on touch devices in downstream components) - make sure this is included in the head also.

## Usage

```
npm install bpk-stylesheets --save-dev
```

Include in your HTML like so:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/node_modules/bpk-stylesheets/base.css">
  <script src="/node_modules/bpk-stylesheets/base.js"></script>
</head>
<body>...</body>
</html>
```

Alternatively you could import the uncompiled JavaScript/Sass directly and let Webpack split them out:

```
import 'bpk-stylesheets';
```
