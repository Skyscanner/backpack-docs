## React components (for web and React Native)

All components are available to consume as React components, exposed as modules on the npm registry. They encapsulate structure, style, and logic which means that achieving a consistent look and feel across Skyscanner products on web, iOS and Android is as straightforward as: installing a package, importing it in a view and using it in JSX. Please see the Text component for [web](https://backpack.github.io/components/text?platform=web) and [React Native](https://backpack.github.io/components/text?platform=native) as examples.

> The recommended way to get started with Backpack on web is to use Backpack React Scripts.
>
> Note: If you are looking to integrate Backpack components into an existing project, be aware that components are published uncompiled which means you'll need to accommodate for this in your Webpack config.

## Backpack CocoaPod

[Backpack for iOS](https://github.com/skyscanner/backpack-ios) is distributed as a CocoaPod. The pod contains several subspecs for different token-level aspects of Backpack such as colour, typography, spacing etc.

## Backpack Gradle package

[Backpack for Android](https://github.com/skyscanner/backpack-android) is distributed as a Gradle package. It contains a module with different Backpack tokens such as colour, typography, spacing etc as a resource file.

## Sass variables and mixins

Backpack's tokens are also available as a library of Sass variables and mixins. Furthermore, most small components such as buttons are also available as mixins. Again, the library is exposed as a module on the npm registry which can be installed like so:

```
npm install bpk-mixins --save-dev
```

The following example demonstrates how to import the module and consume the primary button mixin:

```
@import '~bpk-mixins/index';

.my-button {
  @include bpk-button;
}
```

> Note: `bpk-mixins` only supports [`node-sass`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) and makes extensive use of [`sass-loader`](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader#imports)'s tilde importing mechanism. If you are not using `sass-loader`, you can use [`node-sass-tilde-importer`](https://github.com/matthewdavidson/node-sass-tilde-importer). The `indentedSyntax` option is unsupported.

To get an idea of all the variables and mixins available, head on over to the [full reference documentation](https://backpack.github.io/sassdoc).
