Our graphic devices are a range of visual devices that range from small logo holding shapes to large cropped forms â€” enabling us to create varied and purposeful layouts.

Derived from the geometry of our symbol, these elements allow us to build dynamic, functional layouts that utilise Skyscanner's unique forms.
