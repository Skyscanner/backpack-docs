Shadows isolate a location's often overlooked beautiful details, and build on our visual identity's unique relationship with light.

From nature to architecture, and abstract to prop, our shadow categories capture a wide range of details, allowing us to evoke straightforward or complex experiences.

## Categories

Our use of shadows falls into four categories, which are displayed below in pairs.

### Nature and architecture
