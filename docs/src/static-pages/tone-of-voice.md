## Our voice

It's not just what we say that shapes how people feel about us, it's also how we say it.

Like all voices, it adapts to different situations, content types and audiences, enabling us to communicate with pertinent tone across all applications. To ensure that our tone of voice is on brand, we always keep the traveller in mind, combining our personality's four characteristics.

## Traveller first

Here's an example of some traveller-first copy. Notice how it talks about 'you' — the traveller — and only talks about 'us' — Skyscanner — when necessary, and in the context of how we'll help **them**.

## Core principles

### Helpful relates to the head

This appeals to the rational part of the traveller, the one that’s looking for answers, certainty and logic. So it’s vital that any information we give satisfies this need.

### Joyful appeals to the heart

This is the emotional part of us. The part that flutters with joy at the thought of travel. That feels loyalty and connection — and which can be led by our emotions and mood.

### Straightforward speaks to the gut

The gut controls a person’s instinct. Our travellers will easily suss out when we’re not being honest or clear. We need to communicate in an open and transparent way or we’ll quickly lose their trust.

### Bold engages the feet

This is the physical, the part that wants to get out there: the get-up-and-go. It wants to move. Our writing should inspire action in our traveller by giving them a clear sense of what to do next.
