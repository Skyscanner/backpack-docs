The cool thing about cities, regions and countries is they all have their own, unique personalities. So when we're writing the **'Why go?'** part, we want to really focus on what makes them special, by giving examples of things people can do and experience.

Most important: we don't want it to sound like it could be anywhere. Why do we think travellers will love it?

**Here's an example:**

*Free-spirited San Francisco is known for trail-blazing. The city invented everything from the farm-to-table food movement, to the Big Tech sharing economy (Uber and Airbnb were born here), and is a gay rights pioneer. That means the city always feels exciting: whether you're queuing for the new flavour at gourmet ice cream shop Salt & Straw, or just got a ticket to The Colour Factory, where the rooms are full of balloons and rainbow-coloured ribbons. Plus, SF (only tourists call it 'San Fran'!) is packed with iconic landmarks, like its historic cable cars, the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz island. There are also loads of hands-on museums (feel your way around the 'Tactile Room' at Exploratorium, or enter an indoor rainforest at California Academy of Sciences). Even better, this compact city only measures seven miles by seven miles, so it's super-easy to explore.*

We also want to give advice about **the best time to visit**, because this really affects a trip. It's no fun if, say, all the best stuff is outdoors, and you visit when it's raining. Think about all the factors the best time to visit might include: when things are open, how busy or expensive it is, any festivals or events. Personal tips from your own experience are especially useful here, when you're writing the **'When to go?'** section.

**For example:**

*The major mistake people make is visiting San Francisco in summer. May to August actually gets pretty chilly and foggy - in fact, the fog often covers the Golden Gate Bridge completely. September and October, though, are perfect, with clear blue skies and temperatures in the high 20s. Surrounded by green hills and sea, San Francisco is one of the world's best-looking cities, offering lots of amazing views, and gorgeous parks that look their best in the sunshine.*
