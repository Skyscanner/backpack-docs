We want your voice to be very personal but, when we're writing editorial, it also needs to represent Skyscanner and complement who we are, and the things we believe. Here's how we would describe ourselves:

**"We're  straightforward."** We don't show off with big words. We keep it simple and to the point.

**"We're fun to hang out with."** We're chatty, we get excited about things, and we like to have a laugh.

**"We're trustworthy."** We know our stuff, and we want to share it. We understand travel - what's worth the effort, what's truly exceptional, what will hopefully make people happy and what might not.

**"We love travel and we want others to love it just as much."** Exploring the world is a magical thing. We love trying new food, experiencing new cultures, and having adventures. And we want to get other people as excited about it as we are.

Now you've found your voice, it's time to write.
