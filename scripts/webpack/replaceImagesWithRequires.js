 Custom Webpack loader. 
 Replaces relative image references in Markdown files with React components using a
 `require` statement, so that later in the process they can be captured by `file-loader`.
 
 Turns:
 ![alt text](./image.png)
 
 into:
 <img src={'/' + require('./image.png'} alt="alt text" />
